Insight Project
===============

Work for my Insight project on the effect of the 2nd Avenue subway, as part
of my time during the summer 2017 session in NYC.

Running the entire pipeline and analysis from a clean directory is
accomplished as follows:

1.  Run ``pull_turnstile_data.py``, which will grab all of the full-week
    turnstile data files from the MTA and save them in a directory called
    ``raw_data``.
